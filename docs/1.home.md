ArchGeo is a Python library for processing manifold and orientable meshes based on half-edge data structures.
It provides not only a GUI to visualize the 3D models, including point cloud, curves, surfaces, meshes and vector field, but also an optimization framework to solve geometry processing problems. 
ArchGeo is a powerful tool to do interactive design.



## Triangular meshes


## Why quad meshes?
Quad meshes are extensively used in animation, architectural designs, and industrial analysis.
They are also majorly discussed objects with fruitful discrete theories in Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG).
