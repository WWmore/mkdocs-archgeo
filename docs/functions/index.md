# Python Functions

Please refer to the original [code](https://github.com/WWmore/DOS) to use. 

Core files `meshpy.py` and generalized `quadring.py` include very basic mesh connectivity functions built by half-edge data structures.

The introductions of all these functions are missing. 
Adding all the **docstrings** (between the function heads and statements) need some time. 
Welcome to work together to finish this part! (Final effect [reference](https://gpytoolbox.org/0.2.0/adjacency_matrix/))

<!-- ```
import numpy as np
def mesh()
//quad meshes
```

```py linenums="1"
import scipy
def optimization()
```

#### With a title
```py title="meshpy.py"
def meshpy(self):
    //code
```

#### Highlighting lines

``` py hl_lines="2 3"
def bubble_sort(items):
    for i in range(len(items)):
        for j in range(len(items) - 1 - i):
            if items[j] > items[j + 1]:
                items[j], items[j + 1] = items[j + 1], items[j]
``` -->
