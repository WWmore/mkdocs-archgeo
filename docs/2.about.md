# About

ArchGeo was developed by [Hui Wang](https://www.huiwang.me/), building on the initial research and development by [Davide Pellis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JnocFM4AAAAJ&hl=en), and has its roots in TU Wien's [Architectural Geometry research](https://www.geometrie.tuwien.ac.at/geom/ig/index.php). It has since evolved through projects at KAUST and Xi'an Jiaotong University, resulting in around 20 high-quality academic publications. 
The codebase has been utilized in all of Hui Wang's [research projects](https://www.huiwang.me/publications/). 

For more context in Chinese, you can refer to the PhD thesis [《建筑几何中的网格与光滑曲面构造》](https://www.huiwang.me/assets/pdf/hui-phd-thesis.pdf).

ArchGeo is still under development. 


## Rease history

First released version was on Oct. 2023 for the published paper ["Discrete Orthogonal Structures"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2023.05.024).

## License

ArchGeo is released and used under an [MIT license](https://tlo.mit.edu/learn-about-intellectual-property/software-and-open-source-licensing/open-source-licensing)

## Contribution

ArchGeo remains under active development. It is a user-friendly, Python-based geometry processing tool with an intuitive GUI for efficient geometric design, making it an excellent entry point for research in DDG, CAD, and CG. 
Looking ahead, ArchGeo aims to expand its industrial software applications, particularly in education and research. It also seeks to deepen its integration with industrial tools like Rhino3D and support geometric optimization across various applications.
