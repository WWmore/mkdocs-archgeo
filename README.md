ArchGeo is a Python library for processing manifold and orientable meshes based on half-edge data structures.
It provides not only a GUI to visualize the 3D models, including point cloud, curves, surfaces, meshes and vector field, but also an optimization framework to solve geometry processing problems. 
ArchGeo is a powerful tool to do interactive design.

ArchGeo offers four core features:

* Visualizing any point cloud, curves, surfaces, meshes and vector field;
* Geometrically processing any manifold and orientable mesh;
* Solving geometric optimization problems;
* Fast interactive design.
