ArchGeo is a Python library designed for processing manifold and orientable meshes using half-edge data structures. It offers a comprehensive toolkit for geometric computing and interactive design. Key features of ArchGeo include:

- **Visualization**: ArchGeo provides a built-in GUI for visualizing 3D models, including point clouds, curves, surfaces, meshes, and vector fields.
- **Geometry Processing**: It supports geometric processing of manifold and orientable meshes, enabling users to manipulate and analyze complex geometric data.
- **Optimization Framework**: ArchGeo includes a robust optimization framework for solving geometry processing problems, making it a powerful tool for advanced geometric computing.
- **Interactive Design**: The library is optimized for fast interactive design, allowing users to iteratively refine their models in real-time.

The implementations of ArchGeo related to the paper ["Discrete Orthogonal Structures"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2023.05.024). If you use this library in your projects, please cite the associated paper.
